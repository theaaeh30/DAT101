      <h3>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</h3>
      <p>[It organizes code into reusable objects, making programs easier to understand, 
        modify, and maintain. It helps manage complex systems by modeling real-world entities, 
        encouraging modularity, and allowing code reuse across projects.]</p>
      <h3>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this 
        object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development]</h3>
      <p>[static object is used to store predefined account types, like "Saving" or "Pension." 
        This helps standardize values, reducing errors and making the code easier to read and maintain. 
        Using such objects in software development promotes consistency and simplifies updates across 
        the program.]</p>
      <h3>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</h3>
      <p>[We use encapsulation to protect the inner workings of a class, allowing us to control access 
        to its data and methods. This "hiding" prevents other parts of the code from directly changing 
        important data, reducing errors and improving maintainability. In JavaScript, we create private 
        members using symbols like _ (by convention) or with #, while public members are accessible directly. 
        This approach keeps sensitive data private while exposing only what is necessary.]</p>
      <h3>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</h3>
      <p>[In JavaScript, when we use the new command, it creates a new instance of an object based on a 
        constructor function. It does three main things: Creates a new empty object. Sets the this keyword 
        in the constructor to refer to that new object. Links the new object to the prototype of the constructor, 
        allowing it to inherit properties and methods. Finally, it returns the new object, making it an instance 
        of the constructor.]</p>
